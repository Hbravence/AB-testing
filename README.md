# AB-testing
AB testing 

This repository containes a dataset about website testing. The null hypothesis is that the old webpage is equal conversion rate than the new webpage. The alternative hypothesis is the new webpage has a non-equal conversion rate than the old web page.

Based off my interpreatation of the anaylsis we accepted the null hypothesis.
